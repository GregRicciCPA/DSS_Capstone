# DSS_Capstone
Data Science Specialization Capstone
Capstone Project for the Data Science Specialization

# You are a data scientist now: (Yeah!)

The goal of this data science specialization has been to give you the basic skills involved with being a data scientist. The goal of this capstone is to mimic the experience of being a data scientist. As a practicing data scientist it is entirely common to get a messy data set, a vague question, and very little instruction on exactly how to analyze the data. Our goal is to give you that same experience but with added support in the form of forums, discussion with instructors, feedback from SwiftKey and Coursera engineers, and a structured problem to solve. We hope that you will take advantage of the opportunity this project affords for you to demonstrate your skills and creativity. 

# Course Tasks:

This course will be separated into 8 different tasks that cover the range of activities encountered by a practicing data scientist. They mirror many of the skills you have developed in the data science specialization. 

*The tasks are:
   Understanding the problem
   Data acquisition and cleaning
   Exploratory analysis
   Statistical modeling
   Predictive modeling
   Creative exploration
   Creating a data product
   Creating a short slide deck pitching your product

*The assignments: 
   Quiz 1: Getting Started 
   Milestone Report: exploratory analysis of the data set + evaluation of at least three classmate submissions
   Quiz 2: Natural Language Processing I 
   Quiz 3: Natural Language Processing II
   Final Project: your data product and a presentation describing your final data product
   + evaluation of at least three classmate submissions

# The Data Source:
  This is the training data to get you started that will be the basis for most of the capstone. You must download the data from trhe link below and not from external websites to start. https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip


The Repository will contain Journal, Data sources and code.
