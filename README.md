# DSS_Capstone
Data Science Specialization Capstone 

# *Capstone Project for the Data Science Specialization

# You are a data scientist now: (Yeah!)

The goal of this data science specialization has been to give you the basic skills involved with being a data scientist. The goal of this capstone is to mimic the experience of being a data scientist. As a practicing data scientist it is entirely common to get a messy data set, a vague question, and very little instruction on exactly how to analyze the data. Our goal is to give you that same experience but with added support in the form of forums, discussion with instructors, feedback from SwiftKey and Coursera engineers, and a structured problem to solve. We hope that you will take advantage of the opportunity this project affords for you to demonstrate your skills and creativity. 

# Course Tasks:

This course will be separated into 8 different tasks that cover the range of activities encountered by a practicing data scientist. They mirror many of the skills you have developed in the data science specialization. 

*The tasks are:
   Understanding the problem
   Data acquisition and cleaning
   Exploratory analysis
   Statistical modeling
   Predictive modeling
   Creative exploration
   Creating a data product
   Creating a short slide deck pitching your product

*The assignments: 
   Quiz 1: Getting Started 
   Milestone Report: exploratory analysis of the data set + evaluation of at least three classmate submissions
   Quiz 2: Natural Language Processing I 
   Quiz 3: Natural Language Processing II
   Final Project: your data product and a presentation describing your final data product
   + evaluation of at least three classmate submissions

# The Data Source:
  This is the training data to get you started that will be the basis for most of the capstone. You must download the data from trhe link below and not from external websites to start. https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip


The Repository will contain Journal, Data sources and code.

You will use all of the skills you have learned during the Data Science Specialization in this course, but you'll notice that we are tackling a brand new application: analysis of text data and natural language processing. This choice is on purpose. As a practicing data scientist you will be frequently confronted with new data types and problems. A big part of the fun and challenge of being a data scientist is figuring out how to work with these new data types to build data products people love. The capstone will be evaluated based on the following assessments:

    An introductory quiz to test whether you have downloaded and can manipulate the data.
    An intermediate R markdown report that describes in plain language, plots, and code your exploratory analysis of the course data set.
    Two natural language processing quizzes, where you apply your predictive model to real data to check how it is working.
    A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words), one clicks submit, and it predicts the next word.
    A 5 slide deck created with R presentations pitching your algorithm and app to your boss or investor.
   
# Final Project Submission:

The goal of this exercise is to create a product to highlight the prediction algorithm that you have built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. For this project you must submit:
  1.	A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.
  2.	A slide deck consisting of no more than 5 slides created with R Studio Presenter (https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations) pitching your algorithm and app as if you were presenting to your boss or an investor.

## Review criteria

### Data Product
•	Does the link lead to a Shiny app with a text input box that is running on shinyapps.io?
•	Does the app load to the point where it can accept input?
•	When you type a phrase in the input box do you get a prediction of a single word after pressing submit and/or a suitable delay for the model to compute the answer?
•	Put five phrases drawn from Twitter or news articles in English leaving out the last word. Did it give a prediction for every one? (see NLP quiz1&2)

### Slide Deck
•	Does the link lead to a 5 slide deck on R Pubs? (five slides)
•	Does the slide deck contain a description of the algorithm used to make the prediction? 
•	Does the slide deck describe the app, give instructions, and describe how it functions?
•	How would you describe the experience of using this app?
•	Does the app present a novel approach and/or is particularly well done?
•	Would you hire this person for your own data science startup company?
